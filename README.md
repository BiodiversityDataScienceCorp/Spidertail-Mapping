# Project Description:
### This project aims to support Monarch butterfly conservation by modeling a species of milkweed in the southwest of North America. Using publicly available occurence data of the horsetail milkweed species (*Asclepius subverticillata*) from GBIF and iNaturalist, as well as current and future climate data, we forecast current and future distribution of the horsetail milkweed.
