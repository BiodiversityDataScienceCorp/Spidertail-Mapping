## Draft Species Status Assessment

### Species Name: Horsetail Milkweed (*Asclepias subverticillata*)
### Species Taxonomy: Located within the Acanthaceae family of dicotyledonous flowering plants, mostly tropical herbs and shrubs (britannica.com) and the Asclepias genus, which are defined as the milkweeds (britannica.com)
### Species Description: Horsetail milkweed grows in "feathery clumps or patches and bear[s] white, star-like flowers in round umbels and 3-5 very narrow leaves in whorls at nodes" (wildflower.org); the Missouri Department of Conservation also describes the plant as an "herbaceous perennial, usually unbranched but occasionally with a few branches toward the tip... Fruits smooth, narrow pods less than 4 inches long, erect, bearing seeds that have a tuft of white hairs" (mdc.mo.gov)
### Habitat Description: Found in "sandy or rocky plains and desert flats and slopes; common along roadsides" (wildflower.org) and "disturbed areas, ditches, and streams" (xerces.org)
### Larval Host Information: Horsetail milkweed is "is a larval food plant for both [Queen and Monarch butterflies]. It is also visited by wasps, such as the tarantula hawk" (desertmuseum.org)
### Data Sources: GBIF, iNaturalist
