## Data 
### Description of Data Source(s) for Occurence and Distribution Modeling: 
 ### Our data was pulled from GBIF and iNaturalist, two sources that allow for data to be crowdsourced and accessed by anyone interested in using it for analysis. Github is a database that allows for researchers fromm around the world to upload their data for use in other projects, while iNaturalist contains mostly citizen sighting recordings.
### Description of Data Cleaning Process
 ### In our data cleaning process we removed any data from the data set for which the occurrence status equaled absent, data where the occurrence number equaled 0, and data where the location data (latitude/longitude) is not provided. We combined the data from two sources (after?) cleaning.

## Species Occurrence Map

## Species Distribution Modeling
### The map below shows current species occurrence data in the North American southwest, as well as a prediction of species distribution based on current climate data. In other words, all regions in black are areas with environmental conditions that are suitable for horsetail milkweeds. The red dots show locations where milkweeds have actually been found
### Methods for SDMs
### Map of SDM

## Species Distribution Forecast Estimation
### The map below shows current species occurence data in the North American southwest, and predicts future species distribution based on climate forecast models. These climate models predict that the regions in black are areas that will have environmental conditions suitable for horsetail milkweeks in (What year?).

## Summary of Findings
### The current and future species distribution models (SDMs) above paint a picture of how horsetail milkweed habitats will change over time. In general, they predit that habitat will shrink and move north. In the current SDM, occurences (red dots) and suitable habitat (black regions) almost entirely overlap. In the future SDM, many occurences no longer overlap with predicted suitable habitat. Therefore according to our model, at least some populations will not survive changing climate conditions in their current locations. 
### The implications for Monarch butterflies are clear. Given that Monarch larvae rely on milkweed for habitat, Monarch distributions and population levels will change as milkweeed populations change
