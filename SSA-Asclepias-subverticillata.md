## Data 
### Description of Data Source(s) for Occurence and Distribution Modeling: 
 ### Our data was pulled from GBIF and iNaturalist, two allow for data to be crowdsourced and accessed by anyone interested in using it for analysis. Github is a database that allows for researchers form around the world to upload their data for use in other projects, while iNaturalist contains mostly citizen sightings.
### Description of Data Cleaning Process
 ### In our data cleaning process we removed any data from the data set for which the occurrence status equaled absent, data where the occurrence number equaled 0, and data where the location data (latitude/longitude) is not provided.

## Species Occurrence Map
### Map of Occurrence (presence only) Observations
### Species Occurrence Map:

## Species Distribution Modeling
### Description: The map below shows species occurrence data in the North American southwest, as well as a prediction of species distribution based on current climate data. In other words, all regions in black are areas with environmental conditions that are suitable for horsetail milkweeds. The red dots show locations where milkweeds have actually been found
### Methods for SDMs
